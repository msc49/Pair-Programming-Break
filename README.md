 # Pair Programming Break

 During Pair Programing, I realised sometimes my pair and I would often get too into the zone or lose track of time; as a result, we missed our designated breaks.

 This can be detrimental as many studies point to how taking short breaks lead to greater productivity in a work environment. This is where my interest in automation decided to aid me.

 I created this so that our 1.5 hours, my computer would open up a new window to a youtube video of Drake's music (it's a good playlist!) to remind my pair and I to take a break :)

 ## How to Run this

- ensure you have Python 3.9.10
- copy the repository to your local machine
- cd into the directory where this file is stored
- you do not need to install any modules

Finally now in your terminal, type the following: 

```
python3 main.py

```

Now in 1.5 hours (5400 seconds), the browser will open up the youtube link :)
